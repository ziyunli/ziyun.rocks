Goggles allow you to alter the ranking of Brave search by using rules and filters[^1].

You need to create a plain text file and host it on either GitHub or GitLab. Brave only keeps a reference of the original Goggle file when provided with a link to the original source. If you make it public, it becomes searchable[^2].

I quickly created my [own](https://github.com/ziyunli/goggles/blob/main/snr.goggle) in  <5 mins, and it works like a charm ðŸ¥³

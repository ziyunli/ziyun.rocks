Howdy!

I am Ziyun Li (a.k.a 李子雲), and I also go by Stephen. I am an electrical engineer turned software engineer.

I currently work as a ~~Senior~~ **Staff Software Engineer** at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/), where I am a team lead of the [Instacart API platform](https://docs.instacart.com/connect).
My work increases our grocer partners' GMV (gross merchandise volume) by empowering them with Instacart's grocery delivery service for thousands of orders per day, quickly and reliably.
Before this, I built Xbox One at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) and many fullstack web applications at [D2L](https://www.d2l.com/) and [Top Hat](https://tophat.com/).

*I love hearing about cool technology, interesting projects, and new business ideas. If you have any of these, shot me an email with "hi" at this domain and let's talk!*

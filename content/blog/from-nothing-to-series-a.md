# Step 1: Start
## The Dark Age: The Idea
- Instead of ideas, think about **problems**.
	- Challenge: You tend to focus on what you experience
		- Optimize your anecdotal environment to find *interesting* ideas
	- Note what ideas keep on coming back
	- Find the frontier.
	- Small ideas are best.
	- Examine your market.
	- Environment is everything.
## The Feudal Age: Advancing
- Product Market Fit (Growth)
	- Polish, polish, polish
	- Talk to your users: **personality changes required**
	- Metrics are your map to success
		- Revenue
		- Usage
		- Derivative
	- Consistency
	- A *system* that will propel you to your best self.
## Castle Age: 800 Gold Required == Fundraising
- Stand-out
	- Brand
	- Metrics
	- (Cold) Intro
		- What you do, in a way a stranger would understand.
		- What's different or new about you.
		- Why your market is interesting.
		- Is maximally compressed.
- The Deck
	- Title slide
	- What you're building
	- What problem this is solving
	- What's new or different about you
	- Why your market is interesting
	- Who you are
- Push to meet in person
	- A/B test
- Focus on iteration speed

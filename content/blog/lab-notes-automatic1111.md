I have been sleeping on stable diffusion for a while, but the recent [ControlNet for QR Code](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/141hg9x/controlnet_for_qr_code/) sparked my interest again. So as always, I am late to the party. But I guess it is better late than never.

There is already a comprehensive [step-by-step tutorial](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/qr-code/) on the QR code generation, so I decided to follow it on my first attempt.

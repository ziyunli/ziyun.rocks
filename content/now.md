# Family

We welcomed our second child early this year in February!
I have been spending a lot of quality family time with my family since then, and it has been great!
At the same time, I have been super busy every single day whether it's weekday or weekend.

My daily schedule looks like this:
- 8:00am: Wake up, make breakfast for my older son
- 8:30am: Get my older son ready for school
- 9:00am: Drive my older son to school
- 9:45am: Work!
- 5:30pm: Take my younger son for a walk around the neighborhood
- 6:30pm: Family time
- 9:30pm: Get the kids ready for bed
- 10:30pm: Free time
- 12:30am: Sleep

On average, I get about 2 hours of free time every day. Not bad.
I do plan to go to bed earlier, as I can feel the lack of sleep is affecting my productivity.
And sometimes I also need to do housework during my free time, which means I have around 1 hour that is good quality.
I need to figure out how to make the most out of it.

# Ramping up on DL/AIGC

My plan for this year is to ramp up on generative AI.
But the thing is there are so many readings, and the field is moving at a neck-breaking speed!
So far I have been relatively steady in my progress. Keep it up!

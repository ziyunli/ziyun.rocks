Howdy!

I am Ziyun Li (a.k.a ÊùéÂ≠êÈõ≤), and I also go by Stephen. I am an electrical engineer turned software engineer.

In the past 10 years, I have been building fullstack web applications at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [D2L](https://www.d2l.com/), and [TopHat](https://tophat.com/). But these day, I spend more time on backend servers and systems that deliver massive business impact to the company and its partners.

I currently work as a **Senior Software Engineer** at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/), where I am a team lead of the [Instacart API platform](https://docs.instacart.com/connect).
My work increases our grocer partners' GMV (gross merchandise volume) by empowering them with Instacart's grocery delivery service for thousands of orders per day, quickly and reliably.

Besides work, I also work on side projects from time to time.
